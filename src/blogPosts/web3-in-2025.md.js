# Is Web3 finished, or just underground?

I walked into a Web3 event yesterday (just to wait somewhere until my train arrived), I expected to hear echoes. I thought Web3 was a thing of the past. The hype is gone, the headlines are full of GenAI, and the only blockchain/crypto news is about scam memecoins. No big fundraise, no real momentum in the mainstream market.  

Instead, I found a room full of people quietly building.  

The speculative frenzy is definitely over, but the work continues. The space is much smaller, more focused, and grappling with some real challenges.

### Insights from the panel hosted by Andrea Maria Cosentino, MSc, IMC:

1. **The Community Paradox**  
   There's a dedicated developer base almost exclusively on Twitter/X, but as *Emma Mkrtchian* noted, it's hampered by a high technical bar and a culture that can feel hostile to beginners.

2. **Finding Real-World Value**  
   The focus is shifting from hype to utility. *Joe Morgan* explained how specific industries are still finding real, tangible value in blockchain solutions.

3. **Trust is Personal**  
   In a world of anonymity, your personal brand is everything. It seems to be just as important, if not more, than technical skills. A key point from both *Emma* and *Presence P*.

### My conclusion  
Web3 isn't finished, it just went underground to figure itself out. The question is whether it will re-emerge stronger.  

**Is this the quiet before the comeback or the beginning of the end?**
