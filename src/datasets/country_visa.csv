Antigua and Barbuda,REQUIRED FOR SOME,"For transit passengers who do not leave the controlled space of the airport and are traveling within the same day, a transit visa is generally not required, regardless of nationality, provided they have proof of their onward journey[4][5].

However, if a transit passenger normally requires a visa to enter Antigua and Barbuda and plans to leave the controlled space of the airport or stay longer than a day, they would need a visa.

Here is a list of nationalities that would normally require a visa for entry into Antigua and Barbuda, and thus might need a transit visa if they do not meet the exemptions:

Argentina,REQUIRED FOR SOME,"If someone is flying through Argentina as a transit or layover destination and does not leave the transit area of the airport, they generally do not need a transit visa under certain conditions. Here are the specific requirements:

- The traveler must enter Argentina only to continue their trip to another country.
- They must not change airports within Argentina.
- The transit must be less than 12 hours.
- They must stay in the transit area of the airport without entering the country and without collecting any luggage or making a new check-in with another airline[2].

However, if these conditions are not met, or if the traveler's nationality requires a visa to enter Argentina, then a transit visa may be necessary.

Given the information, it is not explicitly listed which nationalities require a transit visa specifically for Argentina, as the general rule applies to all nationalities that do not meet the exempt conditions. However, it can be inferred that nationals from countries that require a visa to enter Argentina would also need a transit visa if they do not meet the exemption criteria.

To summarize, while the specific nationalities are not listed, any traveler who does not meet the exemption criteria (e.g., staying longer than 12 hours, changing airports, or leaving the transit area) would need to check if their nationality requires a visa for entry into Argentina and apply for a transit visa accordingly. The countries that generally require a visa to enter Argentina are those not listed as visa-exempt in the provided sources[1][2][5].",https://visaguide.world/south-america/argentina-visa/,https://enzel.cancilleria.gob.ar/en/node/3052,https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/transit/transit-visa/eligibility.html,https://www.migraciones.gov.ar/ave/pdf/procedimiento_eeuu-20.pdf,https://voyeglobal.com/countries-require-transit-visa/,,,,,

However, for those who need to leave the international zone, such as to collect luggage or take a land connection, an e-Visa is required.

Here is a list of nationalities that would generally require a visa or e-Visa for any form of entry, including transit, if they leave the international zone:

- Citizens of countries not listed in Armenia's visa-free regime or those not eligible for visa-on-arrival. Here are some examples of countries whose citizens might need a visa, but it is important to note that this list is not exhaustive and is subject to change:

  - Some Asian countries not listed in the visa-free regime (e.g., Bangladesh, Pakistan)
  - Some Latin American countries not listed in the visa-free regime
  - Certain Middle Eastern countries not listed in the visa-free regime

Bhutan,REQUIRED FOR SOME,"If someone is flying through Bhutan as a transit or layover destination and not entering the country, the need for a transit visa generally depends on their nationality. Here are the details:

- **General Rule**: For most travelers, if they are not leaving the international transit area, a transit visa is not required. However, specific nationalities may still need to adhere to certain requirements or obtain a visa even for transit purposes.

- **Specific Nationalities**: The sources do not provide an exhaustive list of countries whose citizens need a transit visa specifically for Bhutan. However, it is clear that visitors from countries other than India, Bangladesh, and the Maldives typically need a visa to enter Bhutan, but this does not explicitly state the transit requirements.

- **Implicit Requirement**: Given that Bhutan has strict visa policies for entry, it is reasonable to assume that citizens of countries that require a visa to enter Bhutan might also need some form of authorization for transit. However, without explicit information, it is difficult to list all such countries.

To be certain, travelers should check with the Bhutanese embassy or consulate in their home country for the most current and specific transit visa requirements based on their nationality[1][5].",https://www.drukexperience.com/traveling-to-bhutan-via-transit-guidelines-and-procedures/,https://www.doi.gov.bt/?lang=en&page_id=192,https://visaindex.com/visa-requirement/bhutan-passport-visa-free-countries-list/,https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/transit/transit-visa/eligibility.html,https://bhutan.travel/visa,,,,,
Bolivia,**REQUIRED FOR SOME**,"The need for a transit visa when flying through Bolivia as a layover destination depends on the nationality of the traveler. Here are the details:

- Bolivia does not have a specific transit visa requirement for all nationalities. However, the general visa requirements can give some insight.
- For travelers who are only transiting through Bolivian airports and not entering the country, the rules are less clear, but it generally follows the visa policies for entry.
- Based on the visa groups defined by the Bolivian government:
  - **Group 1** countries do not require a visa to enter Bolivia, but this does not explicitly state transit rules. It is likely these nationalities do not need a transit visa.
  - **Group 2** and **Group 3** countries require a visa to enter Bolivia. For transit purposes, it is reasonable to assume that these nationalities might need some form of authorization, but specific transit visa requirements are not detailed.

Given the lack of explicit transit visa rules, here are some countries that might require special consideration based on their entry visa requirements:

### Group 2 and Group 3 Countries
These countries' citizens may need to check with the Bolivian authorities for transit requirements, although it is not explicitly stated:

**Group 2:**
- Includes countries like Afghanistan, Algeria, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Cuba, Egypt, India, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Mongolia, Morocco, Nepal, North Korea, Pakistan, Palestine, Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, and others.

**Group 3:**
- Includes countries like Eritrea, Ghana, and others. Again, the full list is not provided here, and it is advised to check with the Bolivian embassy or consulate for specific transit requirements[4][5].

Comoros,REQUIRED FOR SOME,"If someone is flying through Comoros as a transit or layover destination and does not intend to enter the country, the need for a transit visa can depend on their nationality. Here are the details:

- Generally, most travelers can transit through Comoros without needing a transit visa if they remain within the airport and do not enter the country. However, there are exceptions.
- Nationals of certain countries may require a transit visa even if they do not leave the transit area. While the specific countries are not explicitly listed in the sources related to Comoros, the general principle from other transit visa requirements suggests that nationals of countries that typically require visas for entry might also need them for transit.

Given the lack of specific information on Comoros' transit visa requirements for different nationalities, it is advisable to contact the Comoros Embassy or consulate for precise information. However, based on general transit visa practices, nationals from countries that usually require visas for entry, such as those listed in the visa requirements for Comorian citizens (e.g., Iran, Syria, Guinea), might be subject to similar requirements for transit.

Congo (Congo-Brazzaville),REQUIRED FOR SOME,"For transit through Congo-Brazzaville, the need for a transit visa depends on the nationality of the traveler and the specific circumstances of their transit.

- Passengers who continue their journey in the same aircraft or change aircraft without leaving the airport do not need a transit visa[4].
- However, if the transit involves leaving the airport or if the onward flight is not on the same day, a transit visa may be required.

Here are the general guidelines:

- **Visa-exempt nationalities** for short stays, including transit, typically include citizens of Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, and some other African countries. These nationals do not need a transit visa[4].
- **Visa on arrival** is available for some nationalities, but this does not apply to transit situations where the traveler does not intend to enter the country[4].
- **Transit visa requirement**: If a passenger's onward flight is not on the same day or if they need to leave the airport, they may need to apply for a transit visa. This would generally apply to nationals of countries not exempt from visa requirements.

Given the complexity and the lack of an exhaustive list of countries that require a transit visa specifically, here is a general approach:

- **Countries subject to standard visa requirements** (and potentially needing a transit visa if not meeting the same-day transit criteria) include most countries outside of the visa-exempt and visa-on-arrival lists. This would encompass a wide range of nationalities, but specific countries include:
  - Most European countries
  - Most countries in the Americas
  - Many countries in Asia and Oceania
  - Countries in Africa not listed as visa-exempt or eligible for visa on arrival.

To be precise, any nationality not explicitly listed as visa-exempt or eligible for visa on arrival might need a transit visa if their transit does not meet the same-day criteria. However, the exact list of countries requiring a transit visa is not provided in the sources, so it is advisable to check with the Congolese immigration authorities or the nearest Congolese embassy for specific requirements.",https://www.aeroport-kinshasa.com/en/visa_on_arrival_congo.php,https://www.visahq.com/congo-republic/,https://www.afpif.org/afpif2024/travel-and-visa/,https://www.aeroport-brazzaville.com/en/visa_on_arrival_congo.php,https://total.law/fr/france-visa/france-transit-visa/,,,,,
